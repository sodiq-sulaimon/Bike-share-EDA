The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve my recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n\n### Characters and teams\n\n*  **Cyclistic**: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n\n*  **Lily Moreno**: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n\n* **Cyclistic marketing analytics team**: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. I joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how I, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n\n* **Cyclistic executive team**: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n\n### Approach\n\nIn this case study, the six data analysis proces: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act** will be followed.\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Contents\n    1.

Share\nThe key insights gleaned from the analysis are as follows:\n\n* Members use Cylistic bikes more than the casual riders. Members account for 55% of the total rides while casual riders completed 45% of the total rides. However, casual riders ride the bikes longer than members. The average ride duration for casual riders is more than twice for members.\n\n* Casual riders use the Cyclistic bikes more than members in the summer months, July to September. Members use the bikes more than casual riders in the remaining months of the year (outside summer months). \n\n* Casual riders seem to use the bikes more for leisure while the members seem more likely to use the bike to commute to and from work. Casual riders used the bikes far more on weekends. Their usage starts to rise on Fridays and moves up significantly on Saturdays and Sundays from the fairly consistent level on weekdays. Members' usage is fairly consistent throughout the week. \n\n* The bikes are mostly used during the day by both categories of users. Members use the bikes significantly more than the casual riders from 6 a.m to 9 a.m in the morning and between 4 p.m  to 7 p.m in the evening. Casual riders use the bikes more than members in the night from 9pm and at odd hours.  \n\n* The top 2 most popular stations where casual riders start their trips from are close to leisure centres. Pointing us to the conclusion that they use Cyclistic bikes primarily for leisure.\n\n* Casual members generally ride the bikes longer than members throughout the hours of the day.

Act\nHere I will highlight my top three recommendations based on the insights I gleaned from the analysis:\n\n* **Loyalty points:** Cyclistic should consider introducing a loyalty program where member riders accumulate points based on the duration of their ride. The loyalty points could be used to offer discounts on rides or tickets to popular leisure centers. Adverts about the loyalty program may be placed at top 5 stations where casual riders start their trip from. I believe this would help to convert casual riders to members because they usually ride the bikes for longer duration and for leisure.\n\n* **Night life Membership:** An initiative that caters to the need of night-lifers may help to convert casual riders.This could be a membership that gives discount on night rides.\n\n* **Further analysis:** Data about occupation, residential, and work locations of casual riders would be helpful to find out if it is possible to make Cyclistic bikes appealing to casual riders to use for work commute. \n\n\n*PS: I believe that having a conversation with someone that knows the business really well would be helpful in providing recommendations. As such, conversations with my manager and other stakeholders would have been helpful to provide recommendations that would solve the business problem in the best way.*\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Acknowledgement\n\nThis being my first data analysis project with R, completing it was a challenging and interesting task!
